## CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER BEAT OUTLINE

### CHAPTER 1: SELVAGGIO — Beat by Beat

**1.1 — Arrival (ch1_selvaggio_arrival.txt)**
- OPEN: Merdou Akkan stands at the harbor mouth of Selvaggio. The smell hits first — fish oil, tar, sweat, three hundred ships worth of ambition rotting in salt water. The highland air is a memory. This is the lowlands. This is the gate.
- SENSORY ESTABLISH: Heat, crowd noise, the specific chaos of a port that processes thousands of aspiring Renegades per season. Grimoire chatter everywhere — broadcasts playing from stalls, bounty updates scrolling on public boards.
- MC CREATION SEQUENCE: Presented in-world, not as a menu. The MC passes a Wardensea inspection checkpoint. The officer looks at them — this is where height, horns, skin, build are described through the officer's reaction. "Name?" is where the player confirms or changes the MC's name. The inspection form asks for details the player selects.
- CHOICE 1: How does the MC handle the inspection? (Cooperative / Terse / Defiant — sets initial Wardensea reputation and personality axis)
- HOOK: The officer stamps the form. Pauses. Looks at the MC's horns again. "Sennaku?" One word. The MC's response (or non-response) establishes the exile wound without explaining it.
- END: The crowd swallows the MC. Selvaggio opens up — chaotic, massive, alive. Transition to docks.

**1.2 — Docks (ch1_selvaggio_docks.txt)**
- The dock district. Goltieri's territory — his crews control loading, unloading, berth assignments. His name is everywhere (graffiti, whispered, cursed). The MC doesn't meet Goltieri yet, but his gravity is felt.
- FIRST NPC ENCOUNTER: A potential crew member (varies based on MC's path). The encounter is casual — buying food, looking for work, asking directions. The NPC has their own problem that intersects with the MC's need.
- CHOICE 2: Help the NPC with their problem (earns contact, costs time) or focus on finding a ship (practical, misses the connection).
- GRIMOIRE MOMENT: First Grimoire broadcast the MC witnesses — a bounty update on a Cursed Generation captain. The world is bigger than Selvaggio. The stakes are real. Other people are already ahead.
- CONFLICT: A dock dispute — someone trying to cheat someone else, or a Wardensea shakedown, or a rival crew throwing weight around. The MC can intervene, watch, or leave. First opportunity for violence or its avoidance.
- END: The MC learns that ships are expensive, crew is hard to find, and Selvaggio eats people who wait too long. Departure Row is where the serious recruitment happens.

**1.3 — Departure Row (ch1_selvaggio_departure_row.txt)**
- Twelve taverns along the harbor's east wall. 2,000 crew-seeking individuals per season. The MC walks in and the room measures them — horns, height, build, clothes. Highland Oni gear in a Bastion Sea port. People notice.
- CREW RECRUITMENT: The MC meets 3-4 potential crew members across Departure Row. Each has a skillset and a personality. Each has a reason to be here that has nothing to do with the MC. The player cannot recruit all of them — resources and compatibility limit choices.
- POTENTIAL CREW MEMBERS (not all can be recruited in one playthrough):
  - A Rathai engineer with a mouth and a toolbox
  - A Khari navigator who left her warren
  - A Morventhi fighter looking for something she won't name
  - A Human cook who's been at Selvaggio for six months and knows everything
  - A Gorundai ex-soldier who asks hard questions about the MC's plan
- RIVAL CG ENCOUNTER: Mavrokka Deshaan (Oni, Bull Fruit, the berserker) is at one of the taverns. She's loud, she's magnetic, and she's already been down the Kingsrun further than anyone the MC has met. She looks at Merdou's horns and says something only another Oni would say. Respect or challenge — the player chooses.
- CHOICE 3: Who does the MC try to recruit? (Resource-limited — can't afford everyone, some won't come without convincing)
- END: The MC has leads on crew. Needs a ship. Night falls on Selvaggio.

**1.4 — First Night (ch1_selvaggio_first_night.txt)**
- Nighttime Selvaggio. Different animal. The Gambit Fruit's conditions blanket the port district — the bible says this but doesn't specify which Fruit or what it does. Design: the Gambit Fruit user (an Anointed or independent operator) runs a game of chance in the port that's actually a Fruit-powered manipulation. The MC can engage or avoid.
- DOWNTIME SCENE: Whoever the MC is with (potential crew member, alone, or a chance meeting) — a quiet scene. Two people talking on a dock or in a rented room. Character building. The kind of scene that makes the player care about someone before they're in danger.
- CHOICE 4: The Gambit encounter — participate (risk money for potential gain and information) or avoid (safe, miss out). If the MC participates, they learn something about how God Fruit users operate at close range.
- WARDENSEA PATROL (optional): A night patrol passes. The MC's earlier inspection determines whether this is tense or routine.
- CREW BONDING: If the MC has recruited anyone, a moment of humanity — sharing food, telling a story (the NPC's, not the MC's — the MC is silent), noticing a detail about each other.
- END: Morning. Day 2 in Selvaggio. The MC needs a ship today or they're stuck watching the next wave of crews leave without them.

**1.5 — Crew Hunt (ch1_selvaggio_crew_hunt.txt)**
- Day 2-3. Urgency. Ships are leaving. The Departure Bell rings for other crews. Every bell is someone else who got there first.
- SHIP ACQUISITION: The biggest mechanical choice in Chapter 1. How does the MC get a ship?
  - BUY: Expensive. Requires money the MC doesn't have. Kolmari credit? A debt that compounds.
  - WIN: A gambling game, a challenge, a bet with a ship owner. Risky. The Gambit Fruit user from last night offers a path.
  - EARN: Work a job for someone who has a ship. Takes time. Costs days. The Kingsrun doesn't wait.
  - TAKE: Not theft — a ship that was abandoned, a captain who lost their crew, a vessel that needs more repair than anyone else wants to invest. Cheap but damaged.
- CHOICE 5: Ship acquisition method. This determines starting ship condition, starting debt, and initial reputation.
- COMBAT SCENE (conditional): Depending on path, a fight. Not a grand battle — a dock brawl, an alley confrontation, a boarding defense. The MC's Dominion flickers. Armoring sheen on the forearms for half a second. Something is there. It's not reliable yet.
- CREW FINALIZATION: Who's on the ship? The player's recruitment choices from Departure Row pay off or don't. Some NPCs changed their mind. Some have conditions. One might not show up.
- END: The MC has a ship (barely) and a crew (barely). Tomorrow they ring the bell.

**1.6 — The Bell (ch1_selvaggio_the_bell.txt)**
- The Departure Bell. A bronze bell on a stone pillar at the harbor mouth. Ring once for safe journey. Ring twice if you plan to return. Most ring once.
- MORNING SCENE: The ship is loaded (poorly). The crew is assembled (nervously). Selvaggio churns around them — three hundred ships, and most aren't coming back.
- THE BETTING BOARD: The Selvaggio Betting Board outside Departure Row's most popular tavern. Someone has posted odds on the MC's crew. The odds are not good. The crew sees it. Their reaction reveals character.
- CHOICE 6: How many times does the MC ring the bell? (Once / Twice — the choice is presented as simple. Its resonance builds across all three games. If they rang once, someone at Selvaggio remembers. If they rang twice, the promise of return becomes a weight.)
- THE DEPARTURE: The ship pulls away from Selvaggio. The harbor shrinks. The open ocean begins. The crew is quiet. The MC stands at the bow — 6'7", broad, ram horns against the sky, black mane in the wind, ash-white skin catching the morning light. Selvaggio disappears.
- CLIFFHANGER: As the ship clears the harbor, another ship is visible ahead. Flying colors the MC recognizes — one of the rival CG crews they met in Departure Row. They're on the same heading. The Kingsrun has begun.

---

### CHAPTER 2: GALLUUN'S TOOTH — Beat by Beat

**2.1 — Approach**
- 2-3 days of open ocean. The MC's first time on open water (raised highland). Seasickness (if human-raised, familiar; if Oni-raised, this is new and humiliating for someone their size). Crew dynamics emerge — who works, who complains, who steps up.
- NAVIGATION CHALLENGE: The reef approach to Galluun's Tooth requires skill. If the MC recruited a navigator, this is their moment. If not, the MC has to manage it — and the consequences of failure are hull damage.
- GRIMOIRE BROADCAST: Update on the wider Kingsrun — another CG crew hit trouble. Bounty numbers shift. The world notices who's moving.

**2.2 — Port**
- Galluun's Tooth is smaller, rawer than Selvaggio. Coral fang island. The anchorage is reef-locked — one way in, one way out. Fish market economy. The community is 400 people who live by the reef.
- ENCOUNTER: Another CG crew is docked. Tension or camaraderie — depends on who. Suuba Mettani's Kindling crew (Rathai/Varrek, the underdogs) are a possibility here. The MC and Suuba share something: neither was supposed to be here.
- CREW MOMENT: A small scene — the cook prepares the first real meal on the ship, or the engineer finds a hull problem, or the navigator traces the route ahead. The accumulated details that build crew attachment.

**2.3 — The Reef**
- The First Scrape — carving the crew's name on the reef wall. A tradition older than the Great Renegade Era. The MC carves "AKKAN" (or the ship's name, or the crew's name — player choice).
- UNDERWATER/REEF EXPLORATION: The coral reef is alive and dangerous. Something down there — biological, not supernatural. The MC can swim (no God Fruit yet). This freedom in the water is mentioned casually. It becomes significant later if the God Fruit choice arises.
- CHOICE: A reef discovery — something valuable, something dangerous, or something that belongs to someone else. What does the MC do?
- CLIFFHANGER: Grimoire broadcast. A Wardensea patrol is heading south along the Kingsrun. They're inspecting every ship. The MC's bounty (if any) or lack of papers makes this a problem. The crew has 2 days before the patrol reaches Merrenbach.

---

### CHAPTER 3: MERRENBACH — Beat by Beat

**3.1 — Arrival**
- Khari reef island. Warren Suuvi (avian Khari) on the cliffs. The low-tide reef market — temporary, tidal, gone in six hours. The Khari don't build permanent markets because permanent things get taken.
- CULTURAL ENCOUNTER: Khari culture — path-metaphors, distrust of outsiders, the careful hospitality of people who've learned that openness gets exploited. The MC is an outsider. The horns don't help.
- NAVIGATOR THREAD: If the MC recruited a Khari navigator, this is a homecoming or a complication — warrens have politics. If no Khari navigator, this is where one might be recruited, but the cost is different here (favor, not money).

**3.2 — The Warren**
- Inside Warren Suuvi (if invited). Avian Khari architecture — cliff-face dwellings, rope bridges, vertical city. The MC's size is a problem in spaces designed for smaller, winged people.
- A FAVOR ASKED: The Khari need something. A supply run, a message delivered, a threat dealt with. The MC can help or decline. Helping earns trust and route intelligence. Declining is understood but the door closes.
- THE WARDENSEA PROBLEM: The patrol is getting closer. The Khari have information about patrol routes. They'll share it — for a price, or for trust, or not at all.

**3.3 — The Reef Walk**
- The Reef Walk. Khari guide walks you across bare reef at low tide. Follow exactly or cut your feet open on living coral. A trust exercise — the MC must follow someone smaller and seemingly fragile through terrain that could cripple them.
- CHOICE: Trust completely (follow blind — earns deep Khari respect) or maintain control (watch the guide's feet, follow carefully — safer but the Khari notice the hedging).
- WHAT THE MC SEES: From the reef at low tide, the ocean is visible in a way it isn't from a ship. The depth, the scale, the living weight of it. For a highland-raised Oni, this is a perspective shift. The world is mostly water. The MC has been walking on land their whole life.
- CLIFFHANGER: Smoke from Brannach's direction. The volcano. The next stop is under an active volcanic field, and something is burning.

---

### CHAPTER 4: BRANNACH — Beat by Beat

**4.1 — Landfall**
- Volcanic scar island. The heat is immediate — the air tastes of sulfur and metal. Gorundai miners in the fissure walls, extracting volcanic ore prized for weapon-smithing. Brannach is industrial, brutal, and honest in a way the previous stops weren't.
- THE VOLCANO: Active. Eruptions every 18 months. The locals track it by sound — a low harmonic in the rock that changes pitch as pressure builds. It's been building for weeks.
- GORUNDAI REACTION TO MC: Half-Oni. The Gorundai and Oni share mutual respect — both are big, both value physical culture, both settle arguments directly. A Gorundai miner looks at Merdou and sees a kindred spirit with the wrong horns. This is warmth the MC hasn't felt since the highlands.

**4.2 — The Fissures**
- The fissure mines. Deep, hot, claustrophobic for a 6'7" broad-frame Oni. The ore is real — this is where Resonance weapons get their raw material.
- GORUNDAI NPC: A named smith or miner with their own story. They have something the MC needs (weapon, information, a contact further south). The price isn't money — it's a task, a fight, or an answer.
- COMBAT: The chapter's major fight. A rival crew that followed the MC from Galluun's Tooth, or a Kingsrun predator (human, not beast — this isn't a monster-of-the-week game). The fight is ugly, desperate, and the MC's Dominion is tested. Armoring holds for three seconds longer than last time. Something is growing.

**4.3 — The Forge**
- The forge scene. The MC has the opportunity to obtain a weapon. Resonance grade depends on what they can afford and what the smith thinks of them.
- THE SLAG GIFT: A Gorundai offers volcanic glass — "I trust you enough to arm you." Accepting creates a bond. Breaking the glass later is unforgivable (tracked as a flag).
- CREW DEVELOPMENT: A major crew scene — one crew member reveals something they've been hiding. A secret, a fear, a past. The MC's response (through choices) deepens or damages the bond.
- ERUPTION SEQUENCE (conditional): If the timing triggers, the volcano erupts. Not the full eruption — a lateral blast, ash fall, fissure collapse. The MC must get the crew out. Someone gets hurt. The injury persists into later chapters.
- CLIFFHANGER: A crew member is hurt (eruption or combat), and the nearest medical help is Kelvanni — two days south. The ship needs to move. Now.

---

### CHAPTER 5: KELVANNI — Beat by Beat

**5.1 — The Clinic**
- Oursseva Denn's medical station. The free clinic. Overcrowded — injured crews from across the Kingsrun packed into a facility built for fifty and housing two hundred. The MC arrives with a wounded crew member.
- OURSSEVA: A character who matters across all three games. She is not impressed by bounties, Dominion, or ambition. She is impressed by people who carry their wounded instead of leaving them. The MC's arrival — carrying or supporting their crew member — is her first impression.
- NEUTRAL ZONE: Violence at Kelvanni is taboo. Rival crews coexist. Enemies sit in the same waiting area. The tension is social, not physical. The MC sees other CG crews up close in a non-combat context for the first time.

**5.2 — Debts**
- The Debt Ledger. Healed crews owe one favor. The MC's favor is defined but not yet called in — it will be, in Game 2 or 3.
- OTHER CREWS: Extended NPC interaction with rival CG members in a neutral setting. A conversation that reveals depth — a rival captain who is funny, or tired, or more human than the MC expected.
- ROMANCE THREAD: If a romance is developing (through accumulated choices, not a menu), Kelvanni's intimacy of shared vulnerability accelerates it. Two people sitting outside a clinic at night. The conversation that wouldn't happen in a tavern.
- INFORMATION: What's ahead. Velundri is a market where information is the currency. Beyond Velundri is Durromakh — Cassara Vellune's toll gate, and then Ossengaard — the Wardensea fortress. The Kingsrun gets real after Stop 6.

**5.3 — Crisis**
- Something goes wrong at the clinic. Options:
  - A crew breaks the neutral zone (violence erupts in the one safe place)
  - A patient's condition reveals something disturbing (God Fruit corruption, Dominion damage, something the MC recognizes from Oni highland medicine)
  - A Wardensea patrol arrives at the clinic and starts inspecting patients — looking for someone specific
- MORAL CHOICE: The MC's response defines their trajectory. Protect the clinic's neutrality (earn Oursseva's respect, risk personal safety). Exploit the chaos (pragmatic, damages reputation, gains advantage). Or reveal something about themselves to stop the crisis (vulnerable, powerful, irreversible).
- CLIFFHANGER: A Grimoire broadcast — something big. A Conqueror moved. A bounty spiked. A name the MC recognizes appeared in the news. The Kingsrun's stakes just doubled.

---

### CHAPTER 6: VELUNDRI — Beat by Beat

**6.1 — The Market**
- Flat coral platform. Velundri produces nothing — its value is location. The weight-trade market. No currency — goods weighed against each other. Counterfeit weight means ship seizure. The Varrek designed the system. It is precise, fair, and merciless.
- INFORMATION ECONOMY: Velundri's real trade is intelligence. Who's ahead on the Kingsrun. What's happening at Durromakh. Wardensea deployments. Conqueror movements. The MC trades for what they need — but every piece of intelligence has a price, and some of the intelligence is planted to sabotage crews.
- CONVERGENCE: Multiple NPC threads converge. A character who has appeared in an earlier stop shows up here with different information. A connection the player might not have made becomes visible.
- THE CHARACTER WHO ISN'T WHAT THEY SEEM: Someone the MC has trusted (a crew member, an NPC, a contact) is not who they claimed. The reveal can happen here — or the player misses it and it detonates later.

**6.2 — The Revelation**
- The game's emotional climax. Something the MC learns at Velundri reframes the Kingsrun.
- THE REVEAL: Connected to the MC's exile. The First Bout that went wrong — it wasn't what the MC thought. The clan elder who was humiliated — there's a reason the half-blood was targeted. The exile wasn't punishment. It was removal. Someone in the Sennaku Highlands wanted Merdou Akkan gone before they learned something.
- SECOND AGE THREAD: The revelation connects to the suppressed history. A fragment — a word, a symbol, a piece of Silverborn script — that the MC has been carrying without knowing its significance. An NPC who recognizes it. The temperature in the room changes.
- CREW REACTION: The crew absorbs this. Some want to turn back — the Kingsrun was supposed to be about proving something, not about whatever THIS is. Some want to push forward — this is bigger than bounties. The MC decides. The choice is the player's, and there is no correct answer.

**6.3 — The Cliffhanger**
- The ship leaves Velundri. South. Toward Durromakh and the fortress toll gate. Toward Ossengaard and the Wardensea checkpoint. Toward the deep Kingsrun where the water gets dark and the names on the walls get older.
- FINAL GRIMOIRE BROADCAST: The MC's bounty (whatever it is now — could be 0, could be 50M+). Their Grimoire followers. What the world is saying about Merdou Akkan. The betting board at Selvaggio has updated their odds.
- CREW STATUS: Final roster. Who's alive, who's loyal, who's hiding something. The ship's name. The ship's condition.
- THE CLIFFHANGER: On the horizon, past Velundri's coral shelf, the ocean changes color. Darker. The current pulls south. And on the Grimoire — a broadcast from Durromakh. Cassara Vellune's voice: a new toll has been set. The price to pass Stop 7 just tripled. Someone is trying to block the Kingsrun.
- CHECKPOINT CODE: Generated from all major variables. Player copies it for Game 2 import.
- FINAL TEXT: "Merdou Akkan sailed south. The ocean got darker. The crew got quieter. The Kingsrun was not what they thought it was. It never had been. — KINGSRUN: THE DEPARTURE — End of Game 1. Continue in KINGSRUN: THE DEEP WATER."

## BRANCHING STRATEGY

Major branches create alternate scene content within the same files (using *if/*else). The game does NOT create entirely separate scene files for different paths — that's unsustainable at this word count. Instead:

- **Crew composition** changes dialogue and available options within scenes
- **Personality axes** gate specific choice options and NPC reactions
- **Faction reputation** changes how encounters play out (Wardensea hostile vs. neutral)
- **Key plot flags** (Slag Gift, Reef Walk trust, Kelvanni crisis choice) alter later scenes
- **2-3 major branch points** per chapter produce genuinely different experiences
- **The revelation at Velundri** has 2-3 variants depending on what the MC has done

This keeps the game manageable while ensuring high replayability.
