## Title
Kingsrun: Game 1 — The Gate

## Short Description (Tagline)
A half-Oni exile sails south into a gauntlet that kills most crews before they reach the third stop. No money. No name. No ship. Sixteen stops between you and the edge of the world.

## Description (Store Page Body)

**Kingsrun** is an interactive fiction game built in ChoiceScript. You play a silent protagonist — a half-Oni exile named Merdou Akkan — navigating the Kingsrun, a legendary ocean route that stretches south through sixteen stops into waters where the maps stop being reliable and the crews stop coming back.

You start with nothing. Twelve copper coins, a highland coat, and a harbor full of people who've already decided you're going to die. The betting board gives you 200-to-1 odds against completing the route. Three-to-one in favor of picking up a bounty within a month.

**The Kingsrun is not a race.** It's a filter. Each stop tests something different. Selvaggio tests ambition. Galluun's Tooth tests resourcefulness. Merrenbach tests trust. Brannach tests endurance. Kelvanni tests mercy. Velundri tests judgment. The crews that pass all six have been evaluated — by something older than the civilization that named the route.

### What Makes This Different

- **Silent protagonist.** Merdou never speaks. No dialogue, no inner monologue. Your voice exists only in the choices you make. The world reacts to what you do, not what you say.

- **Every choice costs something.** There are no right answers. Helping one person means failing another. Taking the safe path means missing the opportunity. The game tracks four personality axes — aggression, loyalty, openness, mercy — and your crew remembers who you are when the pressure hits.

- **Crew dynamics that matter.** Your crew of four — an engineer, a cook, a former intelligence officer, and you — are not companions. They're people with their own reasons for being here, their own debts, and their own limits. Trust is earned in actions, not cutscenes.

- **A world that doesn't explain itself.** The Dominion system, the Wardensea patrols, the Khari warrens, the Grimoire network — the world is deep and treats you like you live in it. No tutorials. No codex dumps. You learn the same way your character does: by paying attention.
